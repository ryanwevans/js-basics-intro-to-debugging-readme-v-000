# Intro to Debugging

## Problem Statement

When code gets larger than just a few _expressions_ (e.g. `1+1`,
`document.querySelector("#bio")`, we need new debugging techniques. We want to
ask JavaScript itself to help us. We're going to introduce one of the most
essential practices for debugging here: _tracing_.

## Objectives

1.  Define _tracing_
2.  Identify the built-in `console` object for debugging
3.  Demonstrate `console.log()`
4.  Demonstrate `console.error()`
5.  Demonstrate `console.warn()`
6.  Demonstrate `console.table()`

## Define _tracing_

We've stated that `console.log()` can print out data to the console, but we
haven't really discussed why you'd want to do that. In short, it's one of the
simplest, best tools in a JavaScript programmer's debugging toolkit.

_Tracing_ is using output statements (like `console.log()`) to provide feedback
about "what the machine is thinking." Oftentimes we request our code to behave
like a machine, or like a process...

...and sometimes that process doesn't _quite_ give us what we want. Tracing
allows us to check some assumptions. Taking Liz Lemon in the picture as an
example, she'd want to know:

1.  Did the person who places order get my Mac N' Cheese order?
2.  Did the person who receives orders get my Mac N' Cheese order?
3.  Was my Mac N' Cheese order on the receipt? If not, problem happened _before_
    this point (investigate steps 1 and 2). If so, problem happened after.
4.  (Judging by the fact that there are lunches on the table, clearly the order
    got here, was paid for, and was put on the table. No debugging needed)
5.  Who opened up the box of lunch orders?
6.  Did anyone in writers see my order?
7.  If someone saw it, and it's not there, someone took it. If no one saw it,
    call restaurant to make sure they fulfilled the receipt.

We can imagine that Liz could check these steps above with code:

- Check the `Object` of `lunchOrdersForTheWriters`
- Check the value for `lunchOrdersForTheWriters["liz"]`
- Any `writers` `Array` element responds `truthy` to `sawOrder("Mac N Cheese")`?

Debugging the order delivery process like this is "tracing the program."

## Identify The Built-in `console` Object For Debugging

The **browser**, not **the JavaScript language** provides an object called
`console`. When the first Developer tools were released, only Firefox had them.
Firefox chose to call the console `console`, but other browsers didn't have
tooling at all! Over time browsers followed Firefox and rolled in tooling and
_have chosen_ to call the console `console`, but they didn't have to.

This `console` object has specific methods that send text to the DevTools
logging area, which pretty much everyone calls "the console."

## Demonstrate `console.log()`

The `console` object's `log()` method logs general information to the console.
It can take any number of arguments. If more than one argument is provided, the
arguments will be printed out on the same line with a space in between:

```js
console.log('Hello,', 'world!');
// LOG: Hello, world!
```

Importantly, you can log not only simple things like `String`s or `Number`s but
you can log objects and use disclosure triangles to "expand out" the contained
values.

> **TYPOGRAPHICAL NOTE**: When we use `console.log()` in code snippets, we'll
> preface the output statements with `LOG:`, such as in the above example. This
> is to differentiate messages logged out to the console from values `return`ed
> by an expression, which are represented with `=>`, e.g.:

```js
function logReturner() {
	console.log(false);

	return true;
}

logReturner();
// LOG: false
// => true
```

As an example, here's some code. Where might we want to log information to
debug this simple app?

```js
let number = 10;

function addTwoNumbers(a, b) {
	a + b;
}

function multiplyByTwo(n) {
	number * 2;
}

console.log(multiplyByTwo(addTwoNumbers(1, 3))); //=> undefined(?!)
```

- Is what we passed in what the function got?
- Did the function do what we expected it to do?
- Does the operator work like we thought it did?

Try to debug this code using `console.log()`.

To start, `console.log()` will be our main `console` debugging method.
However, you'll also probably encounter the following two `console` methods,
`error()` and `warn()`.

## Demonstrate `console.error()`

The `console` object's `error()` method is for printing out an error to the
console, and it can also take multiple arguments. Most browsers will style the
error message differently from a regular message output with `log()`:

![`console.error()`](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/js/basics/intro-to-debugging-readme/console_error_log.png)

You might ask why we'd ever need to use this — isn't the goal of writing good
code to **avoid** errors? Well, sure, but sometimes errors are out of our
control: the network could go down, data could change, or a user could enter
something invalid. In these cases, it's helpful to use the specialized
`console.error()` method. That way, you're letting future engineers (including
yourself) know that this message is more important than the average logged
message.

> preface the output statements with `ERROR:` to differentiate them from other
> logged messages:

```js
console.error('Uh oh, you done goofed.');
// ERROR: Uh oh, you done goofed.
```

## Demonstrate `console.warn()`

A step down in severity from `console.error()` is `console.warn()`. It provides
a step between a regular `log()` message and a more dire `error()` message.

## Demonstrate `console.table()`

A very handy method to help work with `Array`s is `console.table()`:

It prints a table of entries

## Conclusion

Over the course of your programming career, you'll probably spend
**significantly** more time debugging than actually writing new code. Just as
your coding skills will improve with practice, so too will your debugging
skills. In fact, the [Google Chrome Console Docs][chromedocs] show _additional_
methods on `console` that can format and display your code.

Debugging can sometimes make you feel sad. You'll fix one bug and ten new ones
appear:

If it's any `console`-ation, we **all** make mistakes. Treat debugging as a
learning opportunity. Often, looking at your code critically and trying to
figure out why something isn't working will afford you a much deeper
understanding of how some feature of the language actually works.

Also, sometimes difficulty debugging might hint at a program that needs some
help from a mentor, a pair, or a friend. Some of our best code edits have
started by talking to a friend and saying "This seems...really complicated
and I can't debug it easily!""

We'll continue to use the `console` object and other tools throughout this
course. By the end, you'll be on your way to being a debugging master!
